1. **Importing Modules**:
   - The code imports the `numpy` library as `np`. This library is used for numerical operations, particularly on arrays.
   - It also imports everything from `numpy` using `from numpy import *`. This is redundant because `numpy` was already imported as `np`.

2. **Defining Arrays**:
   - Two arrays `arr1` and `arr2` are defined:
     ```python
     arr1 = np.array([1, 2], int)
     arr2 = np.array([3, 4], int)
     ```
     These are NumPy arrays that store integer values `[1, 2]` and `[3, 4]` respectively.

3. **Adding Arrays**:
   - The arrays `arr1` and `arr2` are added element-wise using the `+` operator:
     ```python
     merged_arr = arr1 + arr2
     ```
     The result, `merged_arr`, is `[4, 6]` because:
       - `1 + 3 = 4`
       - `2 + 4 = 6`

4. **Calculating the Median**:
   - The median of `merged_arr` is calculated using the `median()` function:
     ```python
     median(merged_arr)
     ```
     The median of `[4, 6]` is `5` because itâ€™s the middle value when the numbers are sorted.

   - This median is then divided by `2`:
     ```python
     merged_arr1 = median(merged_arr) / 2
     ```
     So, `merged_arr1 = 5 / 2 = 2.5`.

5. **Printing the Result**:
   - The code prints the result in a formatted string:
     ```python
     print('The Median of array {} and array2 {} is = {}'.format(arr1, arr2, merged_arr1))
     ```
     It replaces `{}` with the values of `arr1`, `arr2`, and `merged_arr1`, displaying:
     ```
     The Median of array [1 2] and array2 [3 4] is = 2.5
     ```

### Summary
This code:
1. Creates two arrays.
2. Adds them element-wise to form a new array.
3. Calculates the median of the resulting array.
4. Divides the median by 2 and prints the result.
